# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BrewLog API currently has basic documentation but lacks clarity for external developers in several key areas. The main issues include: enum values appearing as integers (0, 1, 2, etc.) instead of meaningful names in Swagger documentation, missing XML documentation comments on DTOs and models, insufficient parameter descriptions, lack of validation constraint documentation, and missing comprehensive response examples. This enhancement will improve the API documentation to make it more developer-friendly and self-explanatory for third-party integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an external API consumer, I want to see meaningful enum values instead of integers in the API documentation, so that I can understand what each value represents without referring to external documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing Swagger documentation THEN enum values SHALL display as string names (e.g., "Light", "Medium", "Dark") instead of integers (0, 1, 2)
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL accept both string names and integer values for backward compatibility
3. WHEN receiving API responses THEN enum values SHALL be returned as string names by default
4. IF a client specifically requests integer format THEN the system SHALL provide a way to return integer enum values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an external API consumer, I want comprehensive descriptions for all enum values in the API documentation, so that I can understand the meaning and appropriate usage of each option.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing Swagger documentation THEN each enum value SHALL have a clear description explaining its meaning
2. WHEN viewing RoastLevel enum THEN each level SHALL include description of roast characteristics
3. WHEN viewing BrewMethod enum THEN each method SHALL include description of brewing technique
4. WHEN viewing EquipmentType enum THEN each type SHALL include description of equipment purpose

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an external API consumer, I want detailed parameter descriptions and examples in the API documentation, so that I can understand how to properly use each endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any API endpoint THEN all parameters SHALL have clear descriptions explaining their purpose and format
2. WHEN viewing endpoints with complex parameters THEN examples SHALL be provided showing proper usage
3. WHEN viewing filter parameters THEN the documentation SHALL explain how filtering works and what values are accepted
4. WHEN viewing date parameters THEN the expected date format SHALL be clearly specified

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an external API consumer, I want comprehensive response examples in the API documentation, so that I can understand the structure and content of API responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any API endpoint THEN response examples SHALL be provided for all success scenarios
2. WHEN viewing endpoints that return collections THEN examples SHALL show both empty and populated arrays
3. WHEN viewing error responses THEN examples SHALL be provided for common error scenarios
4. WHEN viewing nested objects THEN all properties SHALL be documented with their types and descriptions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an external API consumer, I want clear validation rules and constraints documented for all input fields, so that I can provide valid data and handle validation errors appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing input DTOs THEN all validation rules SHALL be documented (required fields, length limits, value ranges)
2. WHEN viewing numeric fields THEN min/max values SHALL be clearly specified
3. WHEN viewing string fields THEN length constraints SHALL be documented
4. WHEN validation fails THEN error responses SHALL clearly indicate which fields failed validation and why

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an external API consumer, I want comprehensive XML documentation comments on all DTOs and models, so that I can understand the purpose and structure of data objects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any DTO class THEN it SHALL have XML summary documentation explaining its purpose
2. WHEN viewing DTO properties THEN each property SHALL have XML documentation explaining its meaning and constraints
3. WHEN viewing model classes THEN they SHALL have XML summary documentation
4. WHEN viewing complex properties like TimeSpan or Dictionary THEN their expected format SHALL be documented

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an external API consumer, I want the Health endpoint to be properly documented, so that I can understand its purpose and response format for monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Health endpoint THEN it SHALL have proper XML summary documentation
2. WHEN viewing the Health endpoint response THEN the response type SHALL be properly documented
3. WHEN viewing the Health endpoint THEN it SHALL include ProducesResponseType attributes
4. WHEN viewing the Health endpoint THEN example response SHALL be provided

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an external API consumer, I want consistent and comprehensive Swagger configuration, so that the API documentation is complete and includes all necessary metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing Swagger documentation THEN it SHALL include XML documentation comments from all assemblies
2. WHEN viewing Swagger documentation THEN enum values SHALL be displayed with descriptions
3. WHEN viewing Swagger documentation THEN all endpoints SHALL have complete operation summaries
4. WHEN viewing Swagger documentation THEN response examples SHALL be automatically generated where possible
